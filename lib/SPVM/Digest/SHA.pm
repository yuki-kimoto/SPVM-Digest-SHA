=head1 Usage

  use Digest::SHA;
  
  my $digest = Digest::SHA->sha1($data);
  my $digest = Digest::SHA->sha1_hex($data);
  my $digest = Digest::SHA->sha1_base64($data);
  
  my $digest = Digest::SHA->sha256($data);

=head2 new

  static method new : Digest::SHA ($alg : int)

common string representations of the algorithm (e.g. "sha256",
"SHA-384").  If the argument is missing, SHA-1 will be used by
default.

=head1 Instance Methods

=head2 hashsize

  method hashsize : int ()

Returns the number of digest bits for this object.  The values are
160, 224, 256, 384, 512, 224, and 256 for SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256,
SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, respectively.

=head2 algorithm

  method algorithm : int ()

Returns the digest algorithm for this object.  The values are 1,

SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256, respectively.

=head2 add

  method add : void ($date : string)

Use the input data to
update the current digest state.  In other words, the following
statements have the same effect:

  $sha->add("a"); $sha->add("b"); $sha->add("c");
  $sha->add("abc");

=head2 digest

  method digest : string ()

Returns the digest encoded as a binary string.

=head2 b64digest

  method hexdigest : string ()

Returns the digest encoded as a hexadecimal string.

=head2 b64digest

  method b64digest : string ()

Returns the digest encoded as a Base64 string.

=head2 

  method clone : Digest::SHA ()

Returns a duplicate copy of the object.
